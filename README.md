# Scroller-70
A 75% mechanical keyboard that uses a Xiao RP2040, Choc switches, and I/O expanders.

# This is untested and a work in progress
The design of this keyboard should work, but I have not yet received the PCBs and tested them.

# BOM
3 PCA9505DGG ~6$
1 Xiao RP2040 ~5$
One custom PCB ~20$
Kailh Choc switches (84 pcs) ~40$
Kailh Choc hot-swap sockets (84 pcs) ~10$


# Description
The goal of this project was mainly to build a keyboard to my liking. None of the keyboards I found were exactly what I needed, so I thought, "Why not build my own?" I have been meaning to learn KiCad and Fusion 360.
My currwnet kyebord is one of the old apple usb keyboars, not idle 
My requirements were:

1. Choc switches
2. Hot-swappable
3. Easy to solder
4. Uses QMK
